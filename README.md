## Computer Graphics from Scratch

A 100% from scratch (aside from Windows functions) implementation of 3D rendering written in C.
Written only for Windows systems, because that is what I use.

Based off the great (free!) textbook by Gabriel Gambetta, [Computer Graphics From Scratch](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/).
Since this is a repo solely used for archiving my progress, I won't be accepting any outside contributions. 
I just want to archive my code as I work on this project.

Seriously, this code is not that good. There are no guarantees the code is fully correct, and it's not really well made at all. I have at most 1 year of C experience, so this code is likely terrible.
